# PARKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This is a project based on Parking Management. The program helps us to enter, display or alter the details of vehicles in parking records. Moreover &amp; most importantly the program helps us The program also helps us to know the present status of a parking detail, vehicle detail etc.

It includes various function programs to do the above mentioned tasks.
Data file handling has been effectively used in the program.
The database is a collection of interrelated data to serve multiple applications. That is database programs create files of information. So we see that files are worked with most, inside the program.
DBMS
The software required for the management of data is called as DBMS. It has 3 models
• Relation model
• Hierarchical model
• Network model
RELATIONAL MODEL It’s based on the concept on relation. Relation is the table that consists of rows and columns. The rows of the table are called tuple and the columns of the table are called attribute. Numbers of rows in the table is called as cardinality. Number of columns in the table is called as degree.
HIERARCHICAL MODEL: In this type of model, we have multiple records for each record. A particular record has one parent record. No chide record can exist without parent record. In this, the records are organized in tree (like structure
NETWORK MODEL:- In this, the data is represented by collection of records and relationship is represented by (ink or association.
CHARACTERISTICS OF DB MS: -
• It reduces the redundancy
• Reduction of data in inconsistency
• Data sharing
• Data standardization
DIFFERENT TYPES OF FILES: -BASED ON ACCESS:-
• Sequential file
• Serial file
• Random (direct access) file BASED ON STORAGE:-
• Text file
• Binary File
